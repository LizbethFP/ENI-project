# Project

This project was created for a Peruvian Commercial Fishing Company, called International Business Corporation (Empresa de Negocios Internacionales), looking for a brand new look and feel for their website so as to better present their products to existing and new clients.

## Palette selection

The palette selection for the new website was taken from the company's logo colours.

### Company Logo:

#### I provided client with 2 palette options:

## Protoype

After searching the website information and discussing with client about redesigning it in order to have a dynamic and modern look, we came up with the following understanding:

1. Clients must have a more animated experience with the website.
2. Clients must be able to see products in a dynamic way.
3. Clients must distinguish the products information and photo.
4. Clients can access to the website throught any device: mobile, tablet and desktop. 

I provided the following sketches for a responsive website that focused mainly in the desktop version:

### Desktop Version

Sketches for the website flow from Home Page to Product Section:

##### Home Page:

Sketch for the Home Page where the navigation bar contains the logo and 2 links that takes to Products Section and Home Page.

##### Products Page:

1. Sketch for the Products Page where the navigation bar contains the logo and 2 links, one takes back to Home Page and second one is the current page. The main section displays a slider showing all products with their names in a dynamic way. The left and right arrows from the slider allow to go through products.

2. Sketch for Products Page where a modal opens up when selecting one product from the slider. This modal shows a product photo and information, allows user to close modal with a "x" and provides with an indication text to put mouser over card to get more information about the product. The photo section in the card should have bright colours to draw attention to that specific part.

3. Sketch for the Products Page where the mouse is hovering the card, allowing for a display of product complete information. The background of this card presentation should have bright colours to highlight the important information shown in it, which should be concised in visuals and information.

### Mobile and Tablet Version

Sketch for the mobile and Tablet version where the navigation bar appears to be collapsed in a hamburguer menu and is partnered with the logo. The products are displayed in an ordered manner, both for the product photo and product information, where the photo and one specific information should have the main focus.
